# proxdist
Code for the numerical experiments from publication KL Lange and KL Keys, "The MM Proximal Distance Algorithm", Proceedings of the 2014 ICM, Seoul, S. Korea

Each directory contains the code for one of the numerical experiments. MATLAB M-files are included for all examples. The comparison to graphical lasso includes an R file as well. All folders contain a ``run_*`` M-file to use for replicating the experiments.
